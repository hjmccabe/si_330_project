# SI 330 Project - Harrison McCabe

For SI 330 students:

Yes it's perfectly okay (and oftentimes in pracice, expected) to contain your entire project within an IPython Notebook.
Note that this amount of preprocessing I used is not 100% necessary for your projects, but if you are very passionate about your project and want the results to be extra meaningful, then make sure your data is as precise as possible. 
Also note that my project requirements were different than yours, so use your best judgement when assessing this.
And an obvious disclaimer, do not use code from here without citing me.
